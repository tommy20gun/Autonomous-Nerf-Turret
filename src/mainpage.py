# Welcome to the McIver Autonomous Nerf Turret. The McIver Autonomous Nerf Blaster is an auto-aiming turret that detects and shoots foam darts at targets using a heat-seeking infrared camera. Equipped with an infrared camera, the turret can track and target any object that emits heat greater than the surrounding environment. This project was executed as a hands-on experience for ME405 students, who designed their own autonomous turrets to participate in a tournament at the end of the quarter.
